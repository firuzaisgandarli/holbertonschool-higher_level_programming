# Python Data Structures

This project contains functions working with lists and integers.

- 0-print_list_integer.py: Prints each integer of a list using str.format().
# Python Data Structures

- 1-element_at.py: Safely retrieves an element by index. Returns None for negative or out-of-range indices.
# Python Data Structures

- 2-replace_in_list.py: Replaces an element at index if valid; otherwise returns original list unchanged.
# Python Data Structures

- 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py: Prints all integers of a list in reverse order using str.format().
# Python Data Structures

- 4-new_in_list.py: Returns a new list with an element replaced at a given index, without modifying the original list.
# Python Data Structures

- 5-no_c.py: Removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string and returns the new string.
# Python Data Structures

- 6-print_matrix_integer.py: Prints a matrix of integers using str.format(), with each row on a new line.
# Python Data Structures

- 7-add_tuple.py: Adds two tuples element-wise. If a tuple has fewer than 2 elements, missing values are treated as 0. If a tuple has more than 2 elements, only the first two are used.
# Python Data Structures

- 8-multiple_returns.py: Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character (None if empty).
# Python Data Structures

- 9-max_integer.py: Finds the biggest integer in a list. Returns None if the list is empty.
